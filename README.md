Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV*
framework for structuring and organizing their JavaScript web apps.

Vue, React, Angular… the list of new and stable solutions continues to grow,
but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?

To help solve this problem, [TasteJS](http://tastejs.com/) created
[TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks.

This project, **TodoMVP**, tries to solve this problem with another
approach. It is just another implementation of the same Todo application that
uses the <abbr title="Model View Presenter">MVP</abbr> design pattern to isolate the
application and the presentation logic from any used framework.

The aim of this approach is to be able to test the application without depending
on the chosen framework and to be able to switch or update the chosen framework
with the least effort possible.

This is just an example created by [Alberto Varela](https://www.berriart.com/)
in Typescript without any other dependency library. To demonstrate how it can
helps switching between frameworks it includes two implementations:
Vue and Angular.

If you want to dig deeper in the <abbr title="Model View Presenter">MVP</abbr>
pattern, better than looking into this repository is to read about its
evolution and its multiple variants, including the relationship
of MVP to other design patterns such as MVC, in this

## Running the project

### MVP Application

The application can not run by itself. It's intended to be wrapped by a frmamework of
your choice (Vue, Angular, React,...), but you can test the app behaviour.

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run test
```

### Angular

Implementation using angular.

```bash
cd angular
npm install
npm start
```

### Vue

Implementation using Vue.

```bash
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

## In progress

Remaining todos:

- Switch links by routing
- Create React app
